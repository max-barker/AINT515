# AINT515

This module will provide an advanced knowledge of artificial vision systems for
autonomous robots. It will be underpinned by current theoretical understanding of
animal vision systems and computational models. This module will introduce the use of
deep-learning neural networks in vision systems. 

## Module Aims
- To develop a good understanding of the key problems in robot vision (natural lighting,
scene segmentation, object identification)
- To develop a basic competency in solving these problems.
- To provide an overview of the field of Deep Neural Networks, with a focus on machine
learning and vision.
